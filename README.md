- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicholas! (@Niiiiiicholas)
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science and all things programming! I have worked for big tech companies such as Apple and have a vast background in both Windows and Apple hardware and software
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and soon to be moving into Big O Notation and Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on wide scale Python projects or even just be there to lend a bit of advice on user experience programs. If you need help on your educational journey, I have all my projects for you to view (in case what your prof is saying seems a bit tricky)
- 📫 Feel free to collaborate with me via email at nick_reilly@outlook.com or invite me to your Discord and we can chat
